# TTS Toggle and Step Navigation Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of two key features requested:
1. **TTS Toggle for Pipeline Model Nodes**: A persistent toggle to enable text-to-speech for any model node that outputs text content
2. **Step Navigation Fix**: Resolved the issue preventing action step increment when no node is selected

## 1. TTS Toggle Implementation

### What Was Added

#### UI Components (OrientPage.xaml)
- **TTS Toggle Controls**: Added a new section for text content that includes:
  - "Play Audio/TTS" button for manual TTS playback
  - "Stop" button for stopping TTS
  - **Checkbox**: "Read aloud on completion" toggle for automatic TTS
  - Visual styling that matches the existing UI theme

#### Backend Integration (OrientPageViewModel.cs)
- **Enhanced TTS Logic**: Modified both single model execution (`ExecuteGenerateAsync`) and batch execution (`ExecuteModelForStepAsync`) to check:
  - **Action Models**: Automatic TTS (existing behavior)
  - **User Toggle**: TTS enabled via `ReadAloudOnCompletion` property for any text-outputting model
- **Combined Logic**: Text content is read aloud if either:
  - The model is classified as "Action" (automatic), OR
  - The user has enabled the "Read aloud on completion" toggle

#### Persistence
- **Automatic Persistence**: The `ReadAloudOnCompletion` property was already included in the `SerializableNode` class
- **Pipeline Save/Load**: Toggle state is automatically saved and restored when pipelines are saved/loaded
- **Cross-Reload Persistence**: Settings persist across application restarts

### How It Works

1. **UI Display**: The TTS toggle is only visible when:
   - A model node is selected
   - The step content is text type

2. **Automatic TTS Triggering**: 
   - During "Generate" (single model execution)
   - During "Run All Models" (batch execution)
   - Checks both Action classification AND user toggle setting

3. **Manual TTS**: 
   - Users can click "Play Audio/TTS" for immediate text-to-speech
   - Works with existing audio infrastructure

## 2. Step Navigation Fix

### Problem Identified
- Step navigation (StepForward/StepBackward) commands worked correctly
- Issue was in `ActionReviewService.UpdateStepContent()` method
- When no node was selected, it returned a static message preventing meaningful step navigation

### Solution Implemented

#### Enhanced No-Node-Selected Logic (ActionReviewService.cs)
- **Before**: Returned static message "No node selected. Please select a node to view its step content."
- **After**: Shows meaningful action step information when no node is selected:
  - Current step number (e.g., "Action Step 3 of 15")
  - Event type information
  - Timestamp and duration
  - Raw action details
  - Instruction to select a node for step-specific content

#### Benefits
- **Independent Navigation**: Users can now browse action steps without requiring a node selection
- **Meaningful Content**: Each step shows general action information that's useful even without node-specific details
- **Better UX**: Step navigation works as expected in all scenarios

## 3. Technical Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **OrientPage.xaml**
   - Added TTS toggle UI controls in the text content section
   - Proper binding to `SelectedNode.ReadAloudOnCompletion`
   - Conditional visibility based on node type and content type

2. **OrientPageViewModel.cs**
   - Enhanced `ExecuteGenerateAsync()` method for single model TTS
   - Enhanced `ExecuteModelForStepAsync()` method for batch model TTS
   - Combined Action classification check with user toggle check

3. **ActionReviewService.cs**
   - Improved `UpdateStepContent()` method to handle no-node-selected scenario
   - Returns meaningful action step information instead of static message

4. **NodeViewModel.cs** (previously fixed)
   - Added missing `_textToAudioPrompt` private field declaration

### Data Flow

```
User toggles "Read aloud on completion" 
    ↓
Checkbox updates NodeViewModel.ReadAloudOnCompletion
    ↓
Property is automatically saved in pipeline data (SerializableNode)
    ↓
During model execution, system checks:
    - Is model Action-classified? OR
    - Is ReadAloudOnCompletion = true?
    ↓
If either is true and content is text → Trigger TTS
```

### Step Navigation Flow

```
User clicks StepForward/StepBackward
    ↓
ActionStepNavigationService.ExecuteStepForward/Backward()
    ↓
Calls ActionReviewService.UpdateStepContent()
    ↓
If no node selected:
    - Show general action step info (NEW)
    - Include step number, event details, timestamps
If node selected:
    - Show node-specific step content (EXISTING)
```

## 4. Testing the Features

### TTS Toggle Testing
1. **Create a model node** in the pipeline
2. **Connect input sources** with text content
3. **Select the model node** - TTS controls should appear
4. **Enable "Read aloud on completion"** checkbox
5. **Run the model** (Generate or Run All Models)
6. **Verify TTS plays** automatically when model completes
7. **Save and reload pipeline** - toggle state should persist

### Step Navigation Testing
1. **Load an action** for review
2. **Clear node selection** (click empty canvas area)
3. **Use StepForward/StepBackward** buttons
4. **Verify navigation works** and shows general action information
5. **Select a node** and verify step-specific content appears
6. **Continue navigation** with node selected

## 5. Benefits Achieved

### TTS Toggle
- ✅ **User Control**: Users can enable TTS for any text-outputting model
- ✅ **Persistence**: Settings survive application restarts and pipeline reloads
- ✅ **Accessibility**: Improves accessibility for visually impaired users
- ✅ **Workflow Enhancement**: Audio feedback during automated processes
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Action models still work automatically

### Step Navigation Fix
- ✅ **Independent Operation**: Step navigation works without node selection
- ✅ **Meaningful Content**: Shows useful action information at each step
- ✅ **Better UX**: Navigation behaves as users expect
- ✅ **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality unchanged

## 6. Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- **Voice Selection**: UI for choosing different Windows voices
- **Speech Rate Controls**: Adjustable speech speed
- **SSML Support**: More natural speech patterns
- **Batch TTS Settings**: Apply TTS toggle to multiple nodes at once
- **Custom TTS Messages**: User-defined prefixes for different model types

This implementation provides immediate, practical TTS functionality while maintaining a foundation for more advanced features in the future.
