# Windows TTS Implementation Summary

## What Was Added

I've successfully implemented a simple Windows Text-to-Speech (TTS) solution to read action model node step content aloud. This provides an immediate alternative to complex neural network TTS models.

## Key Components

### 1. WindowsTtsService.cs
- **New Service**: A dedicated TTS service using Windows Runtime Speech APIs
- **Platform Specific**: Uses `#if WINDOWS` directives for Windows-only functionality
- **Features**: Speech synthesis, volume control, voice selection, proper disposal

### 2. Enhanced AudioStepContentService.cs
- **Extended Functionality**: Now supports both audio files and text-to-speech
- **Unified Interface**: Single service handles both audio and TTS
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing audio functionality remains unchanged
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically determines whether to play audio or read text

### 3. OrientPageViewModel.cs Updates
- **Automatic TTS**: Action-classified models automatically trigger TTS for text output
- **Integration Points**: TTS calls added to both single model execution and batch processing
- **Helper Method**: `ReadActionContentAloudAsync()` for action-specific TTS

## How It Works

### Automatic Action Reading
1. When an Action-classified model produces text output, TTS is automatically triggered
2. The text is prefixed with "Performing action:" for clarity
3. Runs in background without blocking the UI

### Manual Text Reading
1. Select any model node with text content
2. Click the existing "Play Audio" button
3. System automatically detects text content and uses TTS instead of audio playback

### Content Type Detection
- **"text"** content → Windows TTS
- **"audio"** content → NAudio playback
- **Other types** → Not supported

## Benefits

✅ **Immediate Availability**: Uses built-in Windows voices, no additional setup required
✅ **Simple Integration**: Reuses existing audio UI and commands
✅ **Accessibility**: Improves accessibility for visually impaired users  
✅ **Workflow Enhancement**: Audio feedback during action execution
✅ **Platform Safe**: Gracefully handles non-Windows platforms

## Testing the Feature

### For Action Models:
1. Create a model node and set classification to "Action"
2. Connect input with action descriptions
3. Run the model - output will be automatically read aloud

### For Manual TTS:
1. Select any model node with text output
2. Click the "Play Audio" button in the UI
3. Text will be read aloud using Windows TTS

### Stopping Speech:
- Click "Stop Audio" button to stop TTS or audio playback

## Future Enhancements

The implementation provides a foundation for:
- Voice selection UI
- Speech rate controls
- SSML support for natural speech
- Integration with neural TTS models
- Text preprocessing for better pronunciation

This solution gives you immediate TTS functionality while keeping the door open for more advanced neural network TTS models in the future.
